# 2026-02-01 : Canadian Conference for Undergraduate Women & Gender Minorities in Physics 

## Topic: Applied Geophysics / Inverse Theory - Imaging Earth's Subsurface with Geophysics
Speaker: Dr. Lindsey Heagy (University of British Columbia)

*Source -> Input Data -> Output Data -> Evidence*

Early theories of tectonic plates (late 1800s-1900s)
- Using Earth's magnetic field to measure magnetism of different substances
- Seismic records
- Continuity of species across different continents
- Gravity measurements (varies at different mass densities among Earth)
- Seafloor striping (magnetic data - magnetite), permanent magnets in seafloor

New advancements in geophysics
- Converting distance between satellites to measure gravity across the Earth
- Computational power to simulate dynamo theory
- Airbone electromagnetic data to fill in continents (ground water / mineral exploration)
- Everyday applications (slope stability, finding unexploded ordnance)

General
- Multiple geophysical experiements to determine intrinsic properities of matierals.
- Skin depth equation = 503*sqrt(p/f)
- Deep subsurface imagining utilizes solar winds, lightening strikes, and other natural sources. 
- Earth's ionosphere - wave guide that bounces lightening strikes around Earth, utilize for data gathering in far away places. 
- Geophysical imaging is analogous to medical imaging.
- Permafrost landscapes (continuous, extensive discontinuous, sporadic discontinuous); point bars.
- Data plotted in pseudosections with electrodes, generates data points in 45 degree lines.
