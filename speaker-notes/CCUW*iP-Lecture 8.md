# 2026-02-01 : Canadian Conference for Undergraduate Women & Gender Minorities in Physics

## Topic: Radiobursts / Pulsars
Speaker: Dr. Ingrid Stairs (University of British Columbia)

### Pulsars
- leftover cores of massive stars post supernova explosion
- Measured offsests gives a TOA (Time of Arrival) from observed pulse -> convert this time to what it would be at the center of mass of the solar system (makes measured pular's spins, rates, and orbits very precise)
- (1970s) believed to be able to detect gravitational radiation created by merging galaxies
- Gravitational waves from huge merging galaxies shold create a noisy background (where Earth bobs around like a cork)
- Relativistic binaries
- Green Bank Telescope (West Virginia)
- Arecibo Signal Processor (ASP): ~ 100 MHz instruments
- NANOGrav creation (via Director of NRAO): Joint telescope collaboration group ~200 people
