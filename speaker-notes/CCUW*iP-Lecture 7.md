# 2026-02-01 : Canadian Conference for Undergraduate Women & Gender Minorities in Physics 

## Topics: Radiotherapy
Speaker: Dr. Magdalena Bazalova-Carter (Universty of Victoria)

### Designing a cost-effective linear accelerator / infrastructure (KOALA System)
- External beam therapy (6-10 MV photon beams)
- Proposed: use 200 - 300 kV photon beams (KOALA radiotherapy system: x-ray tube, iris, C-arm)
- Replaced C-arm with a robot (previously used to assemble automobiles)
- Non-coplanar delivery has less dosage spillage
- Clearer image quality (KOALA CBCT) vs. TrueBeam CBCT
- UPDOG Phantom treatement delivery flow: position patient, aquire CBCT, auto-segmentation, treatment planning (AI), deliver treatment (still need to figure out how to deliver radiation without damaging other tissue)

### Things to work on: 
- treatment couch weight limit
- CBCT Image quality
- automatic organ delineation
- Dose calculations
