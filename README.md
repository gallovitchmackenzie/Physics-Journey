# Physics-Journey

Welcome to my digital physics portfolio!
This repo is meant to track my progress as a student and scientist through coding, problem-solving, and research. 

## Goals

- Expand my coding skills through beginner-friendly physics code
- Document my learning process and progress
- Build familiarity with Github and what it encompasses

## What You'll Find Here

- Lecture notes from physics experts (school visits, conferences)
- Small coding projects
- Reflections on what I'm learning
